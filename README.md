## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MadhuSuniL/prometheusfe.git
   cd prometheusfe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server and open your application in the default web browser. The development server supports hot module replacement (HMR), so changes to your code will be reflected immediately.

## Building for Production

To build the project for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to your web server or hosting service.

## Running Tests

To run tests, make sure you have a testing framework set up. If using Jest, you can run:

```bash
npm test
```

Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Deployment

Deployment steps vary depending on your hosting provider. For example, if deploying to Vercel or Netlify, you can connect your GitHub repository and follow their instructions for deployment.
